# 🚗 Vehicle Data Visualization App

## 🔎 Overview
This project is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that explores and visualizes a dataset of vehicles.  
It demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze data and present insights through interactive charts and dashboards.

## 🎯 Motivation
The goal of this project is to practice data visualization and dashboard creation using real-world vehicle data. It shows how analytics can be transformed into accessible insights for decision-making, making it useful for recruiters, analysts, and learners alike.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Interactive visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots)
- 🔎 Filtering options to explore specific subsets of the dataset
- 📂 Data exploration using Pandas
- 🌐 Deployed online with Render for easy access

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization
